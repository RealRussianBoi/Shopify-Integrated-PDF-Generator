# Shopify-Integrated-PDF-Generator
This is a project demonstrating my competency in Fullstack JavaScript development along with third party integrations such as Shopify. This is a one-page app that fetches products from Shopify and collects input data via react-hook-form and calls the server, which generates a downloadable PDF generated with pdflib.
